    /// application for further error reporting. This initialization method allows you to redirect
    /// all unhandled exceptions to your host application automatically. So even if all things in
    /// your library initialization would fail, you may still report exceptions! Such
    /// unhandled exceptions will be thrown by <see cref="RemoteHooking.Inject"/> in your host. But
    /// make sure that you are using serializable exception objects only as all standard NET ones are,
    /// but not all custom ones. Otherwise you will only intercept a general exception with no specific
    /// information attached.
    /// </para><para>
    /// The second one is <c>Run(IContext, ...)</c> and should only exit/return when you want to unload your injected library.
